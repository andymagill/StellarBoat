# Getting Started with Astro 5

Astro is a modern web framework that lets you build faster websites while using less JavaScript. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of getting started with Astro 5.

## Why Astro?

Astro stands out because:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** — only ship JS you actually need
- **Partial hydration** — intelligently hydrate components that need interactivity
- **Content collections** — type-safe content authoring
- **Multiple output modes** — static, SSR, edge functions

## Installation

Getting started is straightforward:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-site
cd my-site
npm run dev
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions about your project setup.

## File-based routing

Astro uses file-based routing just like Next.js or SvelteKit. Create a file in `src/pages/` and it becomes a route:

```
src/pages/
  index.astro       → / 
  about.astro       → /about
  blog/
    index.astro     → /blog
    [slug].astro    → /blog/:slug
```

## Layouts

Layouts are reusable template files that wrap content:

```astro
---
// src/layouts/Base.astro
interface Props {
  title: string;
}

const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```
