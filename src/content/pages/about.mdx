# About StellarBoat

StellarBoat is a production-ready Astro.js starter for building marketing mini-sites and landing pages. We built it because we kept starting projects from scratch, repeating the same architectural decisions over and over.

## Our Mission

We believe that teams should spend time building what makes their product unique, not reinventing web infrastructure. StellarBoat handles the common patterns—SEO, forms, analytics, blogging, design tokens—so you can focus on your story.

## What's Included

Every StellarBoat fork ships with:

- **Solid Architecture** — Clean separation between core framework and project content, enabling painless upstream merges
- **Component Library** — Pre-built UI primitives and marketing sections (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ, CTA)
- **Blog System** — Full-featured blog powered by Astro's Content Layer API with MDX support
- **Design Tokens** — Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` integration for rapid customization
- **Form Handling** — Multiple backends (Web3Forms, Netlify, custom API) with progressive enhancement
- **Analytics** — Google Tag Manager integration with consent mode
- **SEO Foundation** — Structured data, sitemap, RSS, canonical URLs, all production-ready

## Built for Forks

StellarBoat is intentionally open. The entire codebase is yours to modify. We've structured it so you can:

- Customize fonts, colors, and spacing in one CSS file
- Edit homepage, contact, and thank-you pages without touching framework code
- Add custom pages using Astro's file-based routing
- Extend the blog system with new fields and features

## Open Source

StellarBoat is released under the MIT License. Fork it, deploy it, share it.
