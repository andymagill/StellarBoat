## What is StellarBoat?

StellarBoat is an open-source Astro.js template for marketing mini-sites — product landing pages, campaign microsites, agency client sites, and side-project showcases. It's built around a clear separation between **core framework code** and **your project's content, config, and styles**, so you can pull upstream improvements without merge conflicts in your customized fork.

**Built for:**

- Developers and agencies shipping client mini-sites
- AI coding agents that need a predictable, well-documented architecture
- Open source contributors who want a real-world Astro reference project

---

## Key Features

- **Static-first, edge-enhanced** — `output: 'static'` always; Cloudflare Workers for optional edge enhancements (geo redirects, A/B cookies, dynamic OG images)
- **Content-first architecture** — all site content lives in `src/content/` and `src/config/`; zero content in core components, zero merge conflicts in forks
- **Astro 5 + MDX blog** — Content Layer API, full-featured blog with tags, authors, reading time, RSS, and draft post support
- **SEO out of the box** — meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards, canonical URLs, sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD structured data — automatic per page type
- **Google Tag Manager** — one GTM snippet load; GA4, pixels, and other tags configured in GTM dashboard, not in code; optional consent mode v2 hooks
- **Web3Forms by default** — free, host-agnostic form submissions with email notifications; per-component backend override allows different services on the same site (e.g., Web3Forms for contact, custom API for newsletter)
- **Tailwind CSS v4 + design tokens** — CSS-native `@theme` replaces `tailwind.config.js`; rebrand by editing one CSS file
- **Cloudflare Pages live demo** — canonical demo deployed to Cloudflare Pages; Netlify and Vercel compatibility documented for forks
- **Fully typed** — TypeScript strict mode throughout, including content collection Zod schemas
- **Demo site included** — `src/demo/` exercises every feature; doubles as architecture reference and Playwright test surface

│   ├── styles/
│   │   ├── tokens.css   ← YOUR brand colors, fonts, spacing
│   │   └── global.css   ← core resets and component styles
│   ├── components/      ← core reusable components (don't edit for brand)
│   ├── layouts/         ← core page layouts
│   ├── pages/           ← Astro page routes
│   └── demo/            ← demo content (safe to delete in forks)
├── public/              ← static assets
├── SPEC.md              ← full architecture specification
└── CONTRIBUTING.md      ← contribution guide
```

> **Fork workflow:** customize `src/config/`, `src/content/`, and `src/styles/tokens.css`. Leave `src/components/` and `src/layouts/` unchanged where possible to stay merge-friendly with upstream.
